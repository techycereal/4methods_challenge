# üíª React CRUD Challenge ‚Äì GET, POST, PUT, DELETE

Welcome to the **React CRUD Challenge**! Your task is to build a small React app that interacts with a REST API by implementing the following HTTP methods:

- **GET** ‚Äì Read data from the API  
- **POST** ‚Äì Add new data to the API  
- **PUT** ‚Äì Fully update existing data  
- **DELETE** ‚Äì Remove data from the API  

This challenge is designed to help you practice working with APIs in a real-world React app.

## üöß Your Challenge

Build a simple app (like a Todo List, Notes app, or Journal) and use these four HTTP methods to interact with a REST API.

### ‚úÖ Requirements

- Use **React functional components**
- Use the **fetch API** or `axios` to make requests
- Implement all four methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`
- Display the data on the page
- Use forms to create and edit items

## üåê API Setup

We recommend using [MockAPI.io](https://mockapi.io/) for this challenge.

### Steps to Get Started with MockAPI:

1. Go to [https://mockapi.io/](https://mockapi.io/)
2. Sign in and create a new project
3. Add a new **resource** (e.g., `todos`, `notes`, etc.)
4. Copy the base URL for your collection

Use that URL in your app to make API calls.
